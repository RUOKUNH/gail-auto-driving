# gail-auto-driving
An pytorch-implementation of imitation learning for autonomous driving using PSGAIL

# How to implement 
Just put the whole file in the SMARTS file and put the ngsim file in the SMARTS/scenarios folder
Train by running train.py
To visualize the simulation, run command 
```
scl run --envision evaluate.py ../scenarios/ngsim 
```
